# COVID-19 Testing Suggestion Form
### Description:
This is a simple command-line program written in C that will suggest wether or not you should be tested for COVID-19 based on the responses you give to the various questions. 

### Usage:
* Start by downloading the folder titled `covidForm` and open a terminal window. 
* Navigate to the `covidForm` file location using the `cd` command. 
* After you've navigated your way to the folder, simply run `make covidForm.c` followed by `./covidForm`, assuming no errors arise after `make`. 

That's it. Hopefully some of you will find this interesting! This is a program, that if built in python and made more user friendly, could be used to help people all over the world come to at least a slightly better conclusion as to being tested for COVID-19 or not.

Thanks!
