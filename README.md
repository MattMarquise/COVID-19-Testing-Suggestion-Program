# COVID-19 Testing Suggestion Form
### Description:
This is a simple command-line program written in C which will suggest the user if he/she should undergo a COVID-19 test based on the responses recieved by answering relatable questions. Hope you enjoy playing around with this fun little program!

### Usage:
- Start by downloading the folder titled `covidForm` and open a terminal window.
- In your terminal window, navigate to the `covidForm` file location using the `cd` command.
- After you've navigated your way to the folder, simply run `make covidForm.c` followed by `./covidForm`, assuming no errors arise after `make`.

That's it. Hopefully some of you will find this interesting! This is a program, which can be built in various other programming languages and made more user friendly. This is a simple-survey based suggestion program that could be used to help people all over the world so as to arrive at the very least conclusion of being COVID-19 positive or not.

Thanks!
